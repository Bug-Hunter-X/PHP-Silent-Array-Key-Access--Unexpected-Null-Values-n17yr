In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined. If you try to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP will not throw an error, but instead return null.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and logic errors, especially when performing calculations or comparisons.  Consider this example:

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c'] * 2; //'c' does not exist
echo $value; // Outputs 0, not an error
```

The multiplication involves `null`, resulting in 0.  The absence of an explicit error makes debugging such issues difficult.
